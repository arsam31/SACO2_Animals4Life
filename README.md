# animals4life

For implementing real world situation, I wanted to create a scenario. So animals4life is the scenario
# Animals4life is a rescue and awareness organization
Depending on the region, they are involved with local animal rescue and medical care,and then re-homing of domestic animals or habitat work for wild animals.
Now they are a progressive organization and they are involved in alot of monitoring work, so this can be things like monitoring animal migration as well as monitoring any habitat destruction which is going on worldwide.
And so, the work the company does involves IOT as well as big datasets.
# Global, with HQ in Brisbane Australia - 100 staff
Now they are a global company with a headquator in Brisbane, housing 100 or so staff.
# ..call center,general administration, IT staff, marketing,legal and accounts
Now this covers shared operations,so it's a call center,general administration, IT staff, marketing,legal and accounts.
# 100 Remote workers across australia and globally
Beyond Brisbane there are 100 or so remote field workers who are deployed in regional INDIA and various in-need locations globally.
# Animal care, activists and lobbyists
These remote staff are a mixture of animal care workers,vets and research scientists involved in data gathering work.
In addition, the organization has a number of political lobbying staff to influence government policy.
# Major offices in London, New York & Seattle
The business has major offices in LONDON as well as east and west cost USA.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now the business's current technical infrastructure is a mess.
# Small on-premises data center in Brisbane.
They have a small, on premises data center in brisbane, as well as number of colo facilities, where they rent a total of five racks of space.
The data center is old, and the company who manages them is encouraging customers to migrate out as soon as possible.
# Badly implemented AWS trial in Sydney region
Now Animals4Life have previously had a vendor helping the business run an AWS pilot in the Sydeny AWS region, but it was badly implemented, and it did not provide the resilience and scalability that the business needed.
# A few isolated Azure/GCP Pilots.
In addition, the same vendor helped them with a few isolated Microsoft Azure and google cloud pilots.
All of them were siboptimal, and did not provide the capabilities the business needed.
# Global Offices and mobile staff utilize Brisbane Infrastructure
Now all of the business's global offices , as well as their mobile field workers, consume services from the Brisbone office.
# Cost-Conscious but progressive management team 
Animals4Life is very cost-conscious, but equally, very progressive, and willing to try new things, and adopt new technologies as long as it has a business benifits
